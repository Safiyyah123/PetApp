My Tamagotchi Rabbit, Hooper is a engaging and creative virtual pet app that allows users to care for and nurture virtual pets by feeding, playing with them and tending to their needs. 
Users must regularly check in on their rabbit to meet these needs, as neglecting them can result in the rabbit becoming unhappy or even falling ill.
The app user interface is created with the purpose of providing users a delightful experience of pet ownership with the accessiblity of modern mobile technology. 

## App Purpose
-------------------
The purpose of my Tamagotchi rabbit, Hooper is to provide users with the experience of digital pet ownership. 
Virtual pets can provide users with a sense of companionship and emotional support, particularly for those who may not be able to own a physical pet due to various reasons such as living circumstances, allergies, or lifestyle constraints.
Interacting with virtual pet, Hooper can also provide a distraction from daily stressors and promote relaxation through activities like playing, feeding and bonding with the digital companion. 
My Tamagotchi rabbit, Hooper offers a unique gameplay experience around long-term commitment and real time interaction setting apart from other types of video games.
The app user interface is created based on the purpose. 

### Design Considerations
---------------------------
The Tamagotchi Rabbit, Hooper user interface (UI) is designed keeping in mind of a unique feel to users who never experienced pet ownership. 
The user interface is fun and easy for users to interact with. The background of Screen 1 is of a garden outside of a home backyard surrounded by nature.
The background used is colourful and adds to the enjoyable experience to users. The background highlights the colour green indicating nature. Screen 2 consists of a river and also highlights the colour green displaying nature. 
The purpose of the image is for pets to enjoy and play around nature. The main illustration is the pink and white rabbit which attracts users to form bond with the app. Other main illustrations used is a small ball and a carrot packet in Screen 1. 
The font used are textviews, total of 4. The textviews display numbers from 10 to 100 guiding the user on whether to clean, play or feed pet depending how low or high the numbers are. 
The font colour is specifically selected to suit the background highlighting the text and providing a eye-catching app.
In screen 2, there are 3 buttons used to indicate actions of the pet. The actions are to play with rabbit or bath and feed rabbit.
There are three images of the pet indicating the actions of feed, play and clean.
